# db-and-it-automation-project
Comprehensive academic project on database design and IT automation, developed independently as part of two university courses.

# DB and IT Automation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the automation of sales and logistics processes using the example of AO "Avtotor". The focus is on designing a relational database, creating SQL queries, modeling business processes, and simulating a local network environment.

The project serves as a practical application of database design, data management, and IT automation principles in a real-world context.

## Project Scope
- Database design and implementation in **Microsoft Access**
- Creation of **sample data sets**
- Development of **SQL scripts** for queries and data manipulation
- Modeling of **business processes** using IDEF0 methodology
- Logical and physical **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**
- Documentation and reporting of project results

## My Contributions
- **Requirements analysis** and study of the logistics and sales domain
- **Database design:** conceptual, logical, and physical models
- **SQL development:** queries, schema, and sample data
- **Business process modeling:** IDEF0 diagrams ("As-Is" and "To-Be")
- **Project documentation** and structuring of repository content

## Technologies and Tools
- **Microsoft Access** for database design and testing
- **SQL** for database schema, queries, and data management
- **Dia** and **BPwin** for diagram modeling
- **PDF** for project reporting
